After prohibition, National Bohemian returned with the introduction of Mr. Boh, the one-eyed mascot with a handlebar-mustache and distinctive smile. Instantly adopted as a symbol of a proud city, Mr. Boh continues to be the iconic face for the brand today appearing on all cans, bottles, packaging and merchandise found in shops all over Maryland.\r\n\r\nIn the late '40s, canned beer started becoming popular and National was the first brewer in the U.S. to put six-packs of cans on the market. In following decade, National Brewing continued to proudly represent Baltimore and the Maryland shore, adopting the now famous slogan: \"From the Land of Pleasant Living\". In 1965, National Bohemian became the official sponsor of the Baltimore Orioles. Natty Boh was served at Memorial Stadium and cemented its reputation as \"official\" beer of Baltimore.\r\n\r\nToday, Natty Boh has returned to the traditional recipe that made it the beer of choice in Baltimore and across the mid-Atlantic. Likewise, Mr. Boh continues to be a symbol of the community he so proudly represents and can be seen keeping watch over the city on top of the Natty Boh Tower. But he represents far more than a simple mascot, he is also the uncrowned king of Baltimore and plays a significant role in what makes Baltimore different from any other city in the world!","abv":"4.28","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":93,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ssQJcb\/upload_3BwWGR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ssQJcb\/upload_3BwWGR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ssQJcb\/upload_3BwWGR-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-01 12:24:19","updateDate":"2012-08-25 01:47:50","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":93,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Lager","description":"Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.
